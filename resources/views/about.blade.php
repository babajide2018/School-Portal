                                        to ensure that learning activities are
                                        meeting the needs of their pupils and
                                        extending and developing learning.
                                        assessment results are used to track
                                        pupils’ progress, inform planning, direct

                                        and for reporting purposes.
                                        The overall purpose of assessment is to
                                        support learning. staff at CTI use a
                                        variety of formative assessment

                                        strategies of work. this applies to all

                                        other faiths. This will help them to relate
                                        to world religions. Beyond religions, we
                                        inculcate a deep sense of morals and
                                        respect for the beliefs/customs and

                                        hairstyles are accepted, and the school

                                        parents are to note that they are
                                        responsible for keeping such meals
                                        at the correct temperature,

                                        at school. Hence, the need for parents to
                                        monitor their children at home and
                                        provide relevant information to the

                                        information given can go a long way to
                                        helping the school to determine the
                                        teaching method, learning rate, and other

                                        development. The school expects that
                                        parents assist the children to consciously
                                        work on their homework as and when

                                        Repeated calls will be made until the

                                    <p class="">For the benefit of all pupils, any
                                        child that is ill would need to
                                        present a written note from the
                                        medical officer that treats him/her
                                        where the disease is
                                        communicable. The pupil would
                                        be asked to stay at home for a
                                        period of days depending on the
                                        nature of the disease, but teachers
                                        can interact online with such
                                        pupils where parental consent is
                                        positive along this line. <br>
                                        When pupils are off school because of
                                        sickness or diarrhea, they should not be
                                        sent back to school until 48 hours after
                                        symptoms have passed. Pupils must be
                                        kept off school for a period of time when
                                        they have an infectious or contagious
                                        disease. These include common ailments such as impetigo, conjunctivitis, chicken
                                        pox.</p>
