He said that ABU has always been associated with excellence and gave the assurance that the partnership between IACI and the Institute would be a win-win one.

He mentioned that other factors included institutional reasons such as weak checks and balances; weak internal control system; monopoly of power and large operational discretion and weak law enforcement system.

Urbanisation, deforestation, desertification, over population and all kinds of population issues are some of the resultant effects of man’s interaction with his environment. These changes occur as the people attempt to acquire their seemingly endless desire for food, shelter, recreation and infrastructural facilities.
